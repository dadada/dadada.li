      <h1>My $HOME</h1>
      <p>
        Recently, I came across a blog posting titled
        <a href="https://morr.cc/home-sweet-home/">$HOME, sweet $HOME</a>, where
        <a href="https://morr.cc/">@blinry</a> advocates for structuring your
        <code>HOME</code> directory based on projects and their activity. After
        reading this I felt inspired to finally have a look at the mess I made
        of my $HOME in the last years.
      </p>
      <p>A few things about my old <code>$HOME</code>:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>Documents</code> contained basically everything I had
          accumulated during the last years besides music, videos, pictures and
          source code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>projects</code> just contained one gigantic folder of all
          projects that I ever worked on. - the rest was based on the default
          <a href="https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/"
            >xdg-user-dirs</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you sorted the files by file type like the default XDG directories
        suggest, files from one project may be scattered across many different
        directories.
      </p>
      <p>
        So my goal for the new <code>$HOME</code> was to have a clean directory
        structure where: - it is obvious where to place new files - paths do not
        become too long to type out - the directory structure relates to how I
        work
      </p>
      <p>A quick tour of my new <code>$HOME</code>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>lib</code> for immutable files</li>
        <li><code>src</code> for mutable files</li>
        <li><code>tag</code> stores links to projects</li>
        <li><code>tmp</code> for unsorted files and downloads</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="the-project-directory">The project directory</h2>
      <p>
        All of my projects are stored in <code>src</code>. I use a flat
        directory structure, where every project has its own subdirectory based
        on its name. Projects can become part of one or more larger contexts
        through the use of tags.
      </p>
      <h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>
      <p>
        Tag directories are stored in <code>tag</code>. Each directory stores
        symbolic links to parts of a project that can be distributed around
        <code>lib</code> and <code>src</code>. One possible use for the tag
        directories is creating workbenches. If I use some directories in
        <code>lib</code> or <code>src</code> in different contexts,
        <code>tag</code> can be used to include them in multiple workbenches.
      </p>
      <p>An example workflow</p>
      <pre>
$ cd tag
$ mkdir -p course1/examples
$ ln -s ~/src/example1 course1/examples/
$ ln -s ~/lib/courses/course1 course1/material
$ rm -r course1
</pre>
      <p>
        I create new tags for various reasons, but mostly one for each larger
        context (e.g.Â work, hobbies, admin foo, thesis, courseXY) and some more
        for tracking project activity. There are four different tags in
        <code>tag</code> directory right now for tracking project activity:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>permanent</li>
        <li>active</li>
        <li>hold</li>
        <li>dead</li>
      </ul>
