      <h1>About this web page</h1>
      <p>
        This an explanation (or justification?) of how this page is created. The
        takeaway is that every page is a single HTML file and no templating is
        involved.
      </p>
      <h2>Creating a page</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Copy <code>index.html</code> to <code>page-name/index.html</code>
        </li>
        <li>Update <code>title</code> in <code>head</code></li>
        <li>Write HTML contents to <code>body</code></li>
        <li>
          Update <code>feed.xml</code>. UUIDs can be inserted by calling
          <code>uuidgen</code> from the editor and inserting the resulting UUID
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Why write HTML by hand?!</h2>
      <h3>Reproducibility</h3>
      <p>
        HTML is pretty consistently displayed across most modern web-browsers,
        while multiple templating engines and markdown parsers are not always as
        consistent in their interpretation of markdown, and the details of how
        they render markdown may change over time.
      </p>
      <h3>Debugging</h3>
      <p>
        The feedback when editing the HTML files is immediate without an
        intermediate compilation step that may break when there is an issue with
        some template or the templating engine. Since web browsers are quite
        lenient in what they accept, even minor problems in the HTML will still
        at least partially display the page while it is beeing edited. Developer
        tools of modern web browsers provide extensive feedback about errors in
        the HTML, making it easy to debug the draft. At the same time, errors in
        the templates and the templating engine may lead to arbitrarily complex
        bugs.
      </p>
      <h3>Future-Proofing</h3>
      <p>
        I like to avoid external dependencies if the benefit from using them is
        not significant or easily acchievable otherwise. Static site generators
        include markdown parsers and templating engines which have a lot of
        external dependencies.
      </p>
      <h3>Duplicate State</h3>
      <p>
        A problem with single-file HTML pages is that there are multiple copies
        of the same data, such as the page-style and the URL to the feed. This
        is solved by having very few such data, so it is less likely to change,
        and updating it can be done with reasonable effort through
        search-and-replace.
      </p>
      <h3>Unreadable HTML</h3>
      <p>
        Editing HTML by hand bears the risk that the HTML contains errors or the
        formatting is inconsistent. Formatters like <code>prettier</code> can be
        used to check the HTML and reformat it. The diff can be easily inspected
        to check for inconsistencies between the initial HTML and the formatted
        HTML.
